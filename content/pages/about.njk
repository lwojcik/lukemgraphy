<img class="my-photo" src="/images/me.jpg" alt="Photo of me" />

<p>My name is <a href="{{ siteConfig.author.url }}">Łukasz Wójcik</a> and this cheesily named site is my collection of photography.</p>

<p>I live in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=Warsaw%2C%20Poland#map=11/52.2331/21.0615">Warsaw, Poland</a> and I'm a software developer by profession.</p>

<p>I've been an amateur photographer since 2010s. I'm primarily interested in documentary and history. I capture moments to preserve stories unfolding in front of me. I also enjoy street photography and capturing landscapes.</p>

<p>I use Nikon mirrorless or my smartphone.</p>

<p>Want to get in touch? <a href="{{ siteConfig.author.contact }}">Feel free to contact me!</a></p>
